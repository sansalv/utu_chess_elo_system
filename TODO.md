## Tip: Install TODO Tree extension

### Some future ideas

- Document and comment rest of main.py, player.py and game.py files
- Do edit player info (that changes also the games) to main()
- Check if it's to better to save Player instances to json instead of their names in the games database
- Do backups for the databases

- Source (csv file name) parameter to Game instances (dibs, t. Santeri)
- sources_database/input_database for files that have been inputted to the system ?
- reset_and input_all() method to main() (dibs, t. Santeri)
