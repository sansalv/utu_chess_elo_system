## Tip: Install TODO Tree extension

### Some future ideas

- Document and comment rest of main.py, player.py and game.py files
- Do edit player info (that changes also the games) to main()
- Check if it's to better to save Player instances to json instead of their names in the games database
- Do backups for the databases
