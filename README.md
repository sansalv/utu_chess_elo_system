# UTU Chess Elo System

This is a system that handles and keeps track of our chess club's (Yliopistonm√§en Shakkikerho at the University of Turku) games and player profiles. The chess club organizes events (tournaments/casual playing) every wednesday. The system keeps track of all games and player profiles in JSON databases (hidden from the Github page).

We implemented Elo rating system. Players get their Elo rating (that we named TYLO  = Turun yliopiston Elo) updated after every chess club's event.

Future plans and improvements:
- Website for the club
- Cleaning and documenting the code
- Changing JSON databases to SQL databases (not nesessary but good practice)
